Alliance Exam Vouchers – Now in Workday Learning!
The Alliance exam voucher request form has officially moved to Workday Learning, unifying all external education options in one place. This update applies across all Hyperscalers (Azure, AWS, Google) and many other vendors — making it easier than ever to plan and request your certifications.
You can continue to explore vendor-specific details and links on the Alliances SharePoint and via the MyKyndryl article., including info about voucher policies, attempts, and availability.
👉 Tip: You can also access voucher options directly in Workday by typing “voucher” in the search bar.
